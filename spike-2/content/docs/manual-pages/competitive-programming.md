Code execution is powered by [Piston](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston), the same execution engine used by the `I Run Code` bot. Type `/run` to see a full list of supported languages.

Run `$challenges` to see active challenges. You'll get their IDs there as well.

To submit code, send a message with the following format:

````md
$submitcode ID
```language
code here
```
````

You will receive input via STDIN and are expected to output your results via STDOUT. The prompt may give you test cases to try, but there will also be hidden ones you will need to pass in order to be successful.

*Spike will delete your message submitting code, so make sure it's saved somewhere else!* In return, you'll receive either error output, indication that your code failed verification, or indication that your code passed verification!

You can only have one successful code submission on file per challenge. If you would like to remove a previous successful submission, DM Brandon or Joshua.

Currently, we are not accepting user-generated challenges via a command, but we have plans to add that functionality in the future. If you have a challenge you'd like to see added, feel free to DM Joshua or Brandon with the request!
