The Spike Store is the premier retail outlet for [Spike Bucks](/docs/manual-pages/spike-bucks/)!

## See what's for sale

Run `$help shop` to see what's currently for sale along with pricing.

## How to purchase something

Issue the appropriate command given in the shop. For example, `$buy textemojis`.

## How are purchases maintained?

Purchases assign you a special server role indicating that you have that perk. These roles are maintained by the server, not Spike directly.

## I purchased something in Spike v1. Is it still valid in Spike v2?

Yes. The roles remain the same.
