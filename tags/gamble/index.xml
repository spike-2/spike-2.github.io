The simple game of tossing a coin tries to stay as true to reality as possible. While a coin toss is fairly close to 50/50 odds, it isn&amp;rsquo;t perfectly fair. In fact, depending on the person tossing the coin, the type of coin, and the coin-face chosen, the odds of winning are often closer to 49/51.</description></item></channel></rss>
