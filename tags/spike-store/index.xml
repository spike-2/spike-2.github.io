See what&amp;rsquo;s for sale Run $help shop to see what&amp;rsquo;s currently for sale along with pricing.
How to purchase something Issue the appropriate command given in the shop. For example, $buy textemojis.
How are purchases maintained? Purchases assign you a special server role indicating that you have that perk. These roles are maintained by the server, not Spike directly.</description></item></channel></rss>
