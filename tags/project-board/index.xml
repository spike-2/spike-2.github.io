As you follow your issue (you did file an issue for a bug report or feature request, right?) or PR, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice it head through several columns in the board. Here&amp;rsquo;s what they mean.
Collaborators: Note that Issues are not automatically progressed through the board. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to do that manually.</description></item></channel></rss>
