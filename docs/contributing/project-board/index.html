<p>We use a <a href=https://github.com/jwMaxwell/Spike-2/projects/1>Kanban-style project board</a> to keep organized with feature and bug requests, as well as outstanding pull requests for code changes. As you follow your issue (you did file an issue for a bug report or feature request, right?) or PR, you&rsquo;ll notice it head through several columns in the board. Here&rsquo;s what they mean.</p>
